//! `std::time::Instant::now()` panics on `wasm32-unknown-unknown` ("time not
//! implemented on this platform" — there's no OS clock on that target). The
//! per-op `RLCD_TIMING` instrumentation scattered through `modernbert.rs`,
//! `decision_model.rs` and `agent.rs` is native-only diagnostics that's
//! supposed to be a no-op unless that env var is set, but the `Instant::now()`
//! calls themselves were unconditional — so every forward pass panicked in
//! the browser regardless. Swapping each call site to this shim (a real
//! `Instant` natively, an inert dummy on wasm32) fixes that without gating
//! every individual call site by hand.
